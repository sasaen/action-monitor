# action-monitor
Monitor a database table and notify all the browsers with a session established every time the contents of the table change.

Implementated using Tomcat, Rest endpoints, WebSockets, ActiveMQ and HSQLDB within Spring.
 
 Requirements: 
 - Java 8
 - Maven 3.3.9
 - Spring 4.3.4 
 
 Download the code from https://github.com/sasaen/action-monitor and run mvn spring-boot:run
 
 Notes: 
  - For simplicity Tomcat, ActiveMQ and HSQLDB run in the same JVM. 
    In production ActiveMQ and HSQLDB would run in independent processes. 
	In that case the database listener would need to be in ActiveMQ's classpath and should be a JMS listener (I did not try though).
	On internet I found that Oracle and PostgreSQL databases allow to register a listener using JDBC.
  - The server name is set to localhost in src\main\resources\static\app.js.
  - As for the rest endpoints, I was not sure what the goal was here so I made 2 assumptions. Let me know if they don't meet the expectations:
		- Implemented a simple rest endpoint that returns a fixed version: http://localhost:8080/version  
		- As for the status endpoint, I thought it was a good idea to reuse Spring HATEOAS Actuator endpoint
	      which provide links to other end points: health, metrics, beans, etc: 
		  http://localhost:8080/actuator   
		- To see the Rest documentation generated by Swagger, please visit: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html	
  - There is room for improvement in the browser client, for example the websocket could be connected on page-load and disconnected on page-closed or session expiration.
